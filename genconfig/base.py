class RawFilter(Pipe, EasyWriteMixIn):
    """Base class for Filter objects.
    Filter objects follow a defined protocol:
    First, Filter.__enter__() is called. It returns the Filter
    Then, Filter.next() is called when a new chunk is needed.
    The Filter then may:
    * return the next chunk - you can call Filter.next() again if you need 
      another chunk
    * raise the NeedData exception - you then have to provide input to the
      Filter (see section on input). You can then try again to obtain a chunk
      via Filter.next()
    * raise a StopIteration exception - there will be no further output
      from the Filter. It is pointless to provide more input, the filter is
      ultimately exhausted.
    Note that the protocol is absolutely strict. You have to follow the detailed
    protocol in all respects, otherwise the behaviour is undefined. So, for example,
    you are not allowed to provide input to the Filter unless it raised a NeedData
    exception when Filter.next() was called.
    To provide input you can either:
    * call Filter.send(chunk), sending the filter one chunk of data. You may only
      send one chunk of input at a time, afterwards you have to try to obtain
      output from the Filter. Filters don't buffer.
    * call Filter.last() to notify the Filter that input is exhausted and there will
      be no more input. Many Filters that need to know the whole dataset (like e.g.
      max_) will only yield output after being notified that input is exhausted.
    After providing input, you can try again to get a chunk of output.
    If either StopIteration was raised when you tried to obtain output or you are
    no longer interested in output from the Filter, you have to call Filter.__exit__()
    for any cleanup to happen.

    This Base class RawFilter should only be subclassed by Filters which need full control over
    the protocol. For common cases see the Filter class (functions operating on one
    chunk of data at a time, yielding one chunk of output for every input) and the
    FilterNeedsAll class (functions that require the full set of inputs for any output).

    If subclassing RawFilter, please overwrite send, next and (if needed) __enter__ and/or
    __exit__ with your implementations. You can overwrite last or rely on the behaviour
    that RawFilter._last is True when last was called, False otherwise.
